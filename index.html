                <h1>Our History</h1>
                <p>Nigeria has a rich and complex history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to at least 9000 BC. It was home to several ancient civilizations, including the Nok, Igbo-Ukwu, and Benin empires. The arrival of Europeans in the 15th century led to the transatlantic slave trade and later colonization by the British. Nigeria gained independence in 1960, but political instability, ethnic tensions, and military coups characterized the post-independence period. A civil war from 1967 to 1970 resulted in the formation of the current federal structure. Since then, Nigeria has transitioned to a democratic government and has experienced periods of economic growth and development.</p>
